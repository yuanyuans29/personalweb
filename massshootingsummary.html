        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The number of mass shooting has quickened in recent years 
            According to Wall Street Journal, nearly 200 people were 
            killed in mass shooting for merely past two years. How can we mitigate more shootings? 
            Is there any common trends we can learn from past incidents? Here we're going to dip into history and explore correlations 
            among incidents and different factors, like shooter's choose shooting location, victims injury from different gun types</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The goal of this project is to use Python Matplotlib 
            to explore correlations among number of victims, weapon type, 
            shooting locations, fatality rate in mass shooting incidents from 1966-2016. 
            This could provide us some insights of behind the scene story of these mass shootings.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Data Source</h2>
        <p>Stanford mass shooting csv file</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Definition of Mass Shooting</h2>
        <p>The definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more shooting victims 
            (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. Identifiably gang, 
            drug or organized crime related shootings are not included in the database</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>1. If mass shootings in the United States are higher in certain geographical 
                areas and location types, then geography and location type play a crucial 
                part in the prevalence of mass shootings</p>
            <p>2. If a firearm type, police department proximity, and number 
                of firearms is tied to higher fatalities, then the total amount of 
                victims can be dependent on these variables</p>
        <h2>Analytical Findings</h2>
            <div class ="row">
                <div class = "bar1 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>1. Among all type of firearm used in mass shooting from 1966-2016, 
                    handgun caused more than 1000 victims, which is the single type of firearm 
                    caused the highest number of victims. Also, unsurprisingly, the number of victim 
                    from incidents involved with multiple guns was relatively high as well.</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image1"><img src="image/mass_victimfirearmtype.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class = "pie col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>2. Among of victims from different type of firearm, 39% of handgun 
                        victims were killed and 35% of multiple gun victims were killed. 
                        Thousands of families were shattered and psychological scars in thousands of survivors</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image2"><img src="image/fatalitypercent.png"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="row">
                <div class = "bar2 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>3. Among all states, California has the highest number of mass shooting 
                        incidents in history. Florida, Texas, Georgia are following California 
                        among the large number of mass shooting. According to a recent online article,
                        researchers have begun to see a trend that places with fewer gun restrictions
                        consistently have higher rate of mass shootings.</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image3"><img src="image/shootingsvsstates.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class = "bar3 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>4. When we investigate further on location, surprisingly, 
                        most of mass shooting happened at residential places.
                        Fewer happened at schools, recreation places. Media often 
                        pay more attention to mass shooting at public places which 
                        could cause our misconception of most mass shooting happened at 
                        public places or confusing public of the definition of mass shooting</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image4"><img src="image/shootingsvslocation.png"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="row">
                <div class ="scatter1 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>5. Another factor we investigated using available data is the proximity 
                        of police station near mass shooting location. Presumably, 
                        the closer of police station, the faster police could arrive at shooting 
                        site and lesser victim would be. According to our findings, most police station 
                        located within 5miles radius from shooting site. There is no obvious trends that 
                        shows any correlation between the proximity of police station and number of victims 
                        from mass shooting</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image5"><img src="image/victimvspoliceproximity.png"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="scatter2 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <div><p>6. Number of gun used by shooter could also have impact on the number 
                            of victims. Presumably, the more guns they used, more number of victims 
                            should be recorded. Our findings shows majority of shooters use less than 
                            3 guns, and there is no obvious correlation between number of gun used and 
                            number of victims. In some incidents, shooter used only one gun, but caused 
                            more than 20 victims</p></div>
                    <div class="msa_image6"><img src="image/victimvsgun.png"></div>

            </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>According to Wall Street Journal, The mass shooting in U.S from 1966-2012 
            accounted for 31% of global shooting incidents, more than any other country. 
            And since 2017, the number of mass shooting has increased dramatically and more 
            frequently. They occur without warning and terrifying public. Hopefully, 
            our analysis could provide some valuable insights about mass shooting and 
            implement necessary restrictions to control mass shooting incidents</p>
